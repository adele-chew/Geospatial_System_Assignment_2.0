# Geospatial_System_Assignment_2.0
The second version of the geospatial system assignment, in which more features are added in such as adding collaborators and social media streams. 
Project uses C#, Javascript, ASP.NET and Facebook and Twitter APIs. API Keys removed for security reasons.

I was poor in unit testing, thus the unit tests were not properly implemented.
