# Geospatial_System_Assignment_2.0
The second version of the geospatial system assignment, in which more features are added in such as adding collaborators and social media streams. 
Project uses C#, Javascript, ASP.NET and Facebook and Twitter APIs. API Keys removed for security reasons.

The project can now add, store and locate collaborators, which the user can make use of in emergencies, as well as direct linking to social media streams.

I was poor in unit testing, thus the unit tests were not properly implemented.
